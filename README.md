# React-Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio using React that displays some of my previous projects as well as a little info about me.

* I wanted to make a webpage that serves as a central hub for all my coding projects. 

* I also added a section where employers and other developers can reach out to me and leave comments.

* Each of my previous projects includes a picture of the project as well as the deployed link and Github repo.

* In this project I learned how to use React and some of the react hooks. I also used props in React for each of the portfolio items.
