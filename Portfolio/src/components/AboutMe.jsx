      <p id= "AboutMeP">Hi, I'm Brendan Murfield. I grew up in Kansas City and graduated from the University of Kansas in 2010 with a BA in Communications. I've had a few different jobs in the 15 years since then. A few months ago my brother-in-law introduced me to world of coding and I have been hooked since then. I'm currently enrolled in a full time bootcamp through the University of Central Florida, and plan on getting my certificate in December 2024. </p>
